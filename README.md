Concept code for predicting precipitation using model fields (temperature, geopotential, wind velocity, etc.) as predictors for sub-areas across the British Isle.

The modification of code is required to use your own data. This is because the code is designed for `.grib` and `.nc` files with specific grids. Please see LICENCE for further information on how you can use this code for your purpose.

## Single Location Scripts
* `script/london`
    * Training set: 1980-1989 inclusive
    * Test set: 1990-1999 inclusive

    * Training set: 1979-1999 inclusive

Run the script `hyper_slice.py` to run 10 000 MCMC samples. Afterwards, run `hyper_slice_forecast.py` to sample 1 000 forecast samples. Figures are plotted and saved in the `figure` directory.

The options may be provided which may be useful for development or debugging purposes. The following examples are provided:

* `python3 hyper_slice.py`
    * Does the default number of MCMC samples
    * If MCMC samples are detected from a previous run, only print out figures
* `python3 hyper_slice.py --sample 400`
    * Does 400 MCMC samples
* `python3 hyper_slice.py --sample 400` followed by `python3 hyper_slice.py --sample 800`
    * Does 400 MCMC samples, save the samples, then does 400 more MCMC samples
* `python3 hyper_slice_forecast.py`
    * Does the default number of forecast samples
    * If forecast samples are detected from a previous run, only print out figures
* `python3 hyper_slice_forecast.py --sample 400`
    * Does 400 forecast samples
* `python3 hyper_slice_forecast.py --sample 400` followed by `python3 hyper_slice_forecast.py --sample 800`
    * Does 400 forecast samples, save the samples, then does 400 more forecast samples
* `python3 hyper_slice_forecast.py --sample 400 --burnin 100`
    * Does 400 forecast samples with a burn in of 100. If `--burnin` is not provided, the default burn in is used.

Results are saved in the `result` directory. Delete it if you wish to restart the sampling process from the start.

## Multiple Locations Scripts
* `script/isle_of_man`
    * Training set: 1980-1989 inclusive
    * Test set: 1990-1999 inclusive
* `script/wales_10`
    * Training set: 1980-1989 inclusive
    * Test set: 1990-1999 inclusive
* `script/wales_10_20`
    * Training set: 1990-1999 inclusive
    * Test set: 2000-2019 inclusive
* `script/wales_20_20`
    * Training set: 1979-1999 inclusive
    * Test set: 2000-2019 inclusive

For the Wales dataset, use `mpiexec -n 8 python3 -m mpi4py.futures downscale.py` to use 8 threads for example.

Run the script `downscale.py` and `dual.py` to do MCMC sampling without/with model field sampling respectively. Afterwards, run the script `downscale_forecast.py` and/or `dual_forecast.py` to do forecast sampling without/with model field sampling respectively.

The options may be provided which may be useful for development or debugging purposes. The following examples are provided:

* `python3 downscale.py`
    * Does the default number of MCMC samples
    * If MCMC samples are detected from a previous run, only print out figures
* `python3 downscale.py --sample 400`
    * Does 400 MCMC samples
* `python3 downscale.py --sample 400` followed by `python3 downscale.py --sample 800`
    * Does 400 MCMC samples, save the samples, then does 400 more MCMC samples
* `python3 downscale_forecast.py`
    * Does the default number of forecast samples
    * If forecast samples are detected from a previous run, only print out figures
* `python3 downscale_forecast.py --sample 400`
    * Does 400 forecast samples
* `python3 downscale_forecast.py --sample 400` followed by `python3 downscale_forecast.py --sample 800`
    * Does 400 forecast samples, save the samples, then does 400 more forecast samples
* `python3 downscale_forecast.py --sample 400 --burnin 100`
    * Does 400 forecast samples with a burn in of 100. If `--burnin` is not provided, the default burn in is used.
* `python3 downscale_forecast.py --noprint`
    * Does not print forecast figures

The code uses multiple threads so using a multi-core processor(s) is recommended.

## Notes for Developers
* Please see the package `compound_poisson` for under the hood code and documentations.
* There is a bug for `dual_forecast.py` scripts for large datasets and large MCMC samples. RAM usage increase rapidly which may be fixed by careful memory management.
* The options are there for debugging purposes and/or to cater for limited resources such as time.
* A note on reproducibility. Results store many random number generators and their states which are used MCMC sampling and forecasting, therefore figures are reproducible. However, obtaining more MCMC samples after forecasting will cause future forecasts to use a different set of random numbers. Making a backup of the results before any forecasting is recommended.
